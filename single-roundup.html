                        <p>Children continue to grow and develop well into their teenage years, so the effects of substances and medications that are considered predictable in adults may not be in children. When it comes to things like CBD products, there is some concern about safety. </p>
                        <p>Marijuana intoxication in children can be very dangerous, but not all CBD products contain THC. Cannabidiol has been widely tested in adults[1] for conditions ranging from chronic pain to epilepsy, and some studies even show promise for CBD use in children. It’s always important to follow your pediatrician’s recommendations, but cannabis use could help children with certain conditions. </p>
                        <p>In this article, we’ll explore the subject of CBD oil and gummies for kids. You’ll learn the basics about CBD oil and gummies for children including the potential health benefits as well as the side effects. You’ll also see our top 10 picks for the safest cannabis products for children.</p>

                        <h2>CBD For Kids (With ADHD)</h2>
                        <p>Cannabidiol or CBD is extracted from the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa, which is also the species that Marijuana comes from as well as two other varieties of the same plant, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. Though cannabinoids like CBD are abundant in both, cannabidiol doesn’t have the psychoactive properties associated with marijuana. These effects are linked to another cannabinoid called tetrahydrocannabinol or THC[2]. </p>
                        <p>Medical research  [3] regarding therapeutic applications for CBD is ongoing, but numerous studies support its use for concerns ranging from seizures to chronic pain and inflammation. In fact, some of the strongest support for the medical use of CBD is for the treatment of seizure disorders like Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome in children and adults.</p>
                        <h2>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h2>
                        <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD is by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity which present before the age of 12. Research reveals[4] the role of abnormal dopamine transmission and dopamine deficiency in this condition which suggests the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in some way. Though CBD has been shown to improve hyperactivity in autistic children, it hasn’t been studied as extensively for ADHD. Anecdotal support exists for the use of CBD oil as an ADHD treatment in kids, but there isn’t enough scientific evidence to support this particular application. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Research on CBD use in children is still somewhat limited, but several studies have shown promising results. Read on to learn more about CBD oil for kids and to see our top 5 picks.</p>

                        <h2>Using CBD Oil & Gummies for Children</h2>        
                        <p>No parent wants to see their child suffer. Kids with anxiety, ADHD symptoms, and other mental health issues may struggle at school and at home. Depending on the severity of their symptoms, it could impact the child’s daily life as well. For pharmaceutical drugs, these problems exist, but there is always a risk for side effects. If you’re exploring alternative options for symptom management, you may be wondering about CBD. </p>
                        <h3>Will CBD Make My Child High? </h3>
                        <p>One of the most important things parents need to know is that pure cannabidiol will not make their child high the way marijuana would. Marijuana contains cannabidiol, but its concentrations of THC are much higher. </p>
                        <p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid compound like CBD that occurs naturally in the cannabis plant and it is known for producing psychoactive effects. The cannabidiol oil used to make CBD gummies is typically derived from hemp (Cannabis sativa) while marijuana is derived from Cannabis indica and sativa. CBD oil made with full-spectrum hemp (a whole-plant extract) may contain trace amounts of THC, but it can legally only contain up to 0.3% by dry weight. </p>
                        <p>If you want to be absolutely certain your child isn’t accidentally ingesting THC, choose broad-spectrum CBD gummies. Broad-spectrum cannabidiol oil doesn’t contain any THC.</p>
                        <h3>Is CBD Safe For Children?</h3>
                        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reviewed the evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of CBD. In their report, the WHO concluded[9] that “CBD is generally well tolerated with a good safety profile.” That being said, medications and supplements may affect children differently than adults. Clinical evidence of using CBD in children is still fairly limited, so parents should follow their pediatrician’s advice and exercise caution when using CBD. </p>
                        <h3>Is It Legal To Give CBD To Children?</h3>
                        <p>Because it comes from the same plant as marijuana, CBD was long considered a Schedule 1 substance which has made it difficult to study. The DEA eased some of those restrictions in 2015 and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018[10] (the 2018 Farm Bill) made it legal to sell CBD products as long as they contain less than 0.3% THC by dry weight. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Though CBD is legal in many states, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still has the right to regulate products that contain cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. To date, the FDA has only approved one cannabis-derived drug product, Epidiolex. This drug contains a purified form of CBD and is used for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  [11] or Dravet syndrome as well as tuberous sclerosis in children 2 years and older. In other words, the FDA has concluded that this drug is both safe and effective for its intended use. </p>
                        <p>Certain states may have some restrictions for purchasing CBD, but hemp-derived CBD products are legal on the federal level as long as they contain under 0.3% THC. Marijuana is illegal on the federal level, and it is not legal to give THC to children. Because some CBD products contain trace amounts of THC, the legality of these products for children is something of a gray area. At this point, it is up to the parent to make a responsible decision regarding CBD use. </p>
                        <h3>CBD Oil & Gummies Benefits For Kids</h3>
                        <p>Before considering CBD for your child, you should understand what it is and how it works. Cannabidiol or CBD is a cannabinoid compound derived from the Cannabis plant. Cannabis sativa (hemp) contains high concentrations of CBD while Cannabis indica (marijuana) has higher concentrations of THC. Both contain over 400 different chemical compounds  [12], over 60 of which are various types of cannabinoid.</p>
                        <p>The effects of cannabis are still being studied, but cannabinoids like CBD and THC have been shown to induce physiological changes by acting on the endocannabinoid system in the body. This is a complex cell-signalling system that plays a role in regulating key body functions and maintaining homeostasis. Some studies show the benefits of CBD may be heightened when combined with other phytocompounds[13] like terpenes – this is called the entourage effect. </p>
                        <p>When it comes to scientific research, CBD has been studied for common ailments like chronic pain, inflammation, anxiety, and insomnia in adults. Scientific support for CBD as an effective treatment for these and other conditions is ongoing. When it comes to CBD oil for children, research is even more limited. </p>
                        <h4>Here’s what you need to know about some of the most well-studied uses of CBD for children: </h4>
                        <h5>Autism</h5>
                        <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, nonverbal communication, repetitive behaviors, and speech. The CDC estimates autism affects 1 in 54 children[14] in the United States. Scientific understanding of autism is still limited, but many studies are ongoing. In fact, several studies have been conducted regarding the use of medical cannabis and CBD oil for children with autism.</p>
                        <p>A data analysis  [15]  conducted using data collected from ASD patients treated with medical cannabis between 2015 and 2017 revealed significant improvement in autism symptoms in over 30% of patients and moderate improvement in over 50%. Unfortunately, over 25% of patients experienced side effects of medical marijuana use, the most common being restlessness. </p>
                        <p>Regarding CBD oil in particular, one study  [16] found that cannabidiol reduced autism symptoms such as self-injury and rage attacks by 68.4%. Hyperactivity improved in 68% and sleep problems improved in over 71% of patients. Over 47% of patients also experienced anxiety relief. Adverse effects were mild across the board.</p>
                        <h5>Seizures</h5>
                        <p>Perhaps the most widely studied use of cannabidiol in children is for epilepsy, particularly rare seizure disorders like Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Epidiolex is the first FDA-approved[17] cannabis-based drug, its effectiveness supported by three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug trials[18]. In another study[19], adding CBD to current treatments significantly reduced seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. </p>
                        <p>Another study[20] tested the efficacy of CBD-enriched cannabis extract for patients with refractory epilepsy aged 1 to 20. Over 50% of patients experienced a reduction in the frequency of seizures and younger age at onset paired with higher CBD dose were associated with a better response to treatment.</p>
                        <h5>Pain</h5>
                        <p>According to a 2018 study  [21] of cannabidiol use, over 60% of CBD users take it as a treatment for pain. Numerous studies have shown the pain-relieving benefits of CBD oil as well as inflammation reduction. These benefits are attributed to the effects of cannabidiol on the endocannabinoid system, though the exact mechanisms through which these benefits are achieved is still unclear.</p>
                        <p>Research regarding the use of CBD for pain relief is primarily limited to animal studies and studies involving adult subjects. Though research involving children is much less common, the potential benefits of CBD for pain in children may be extrapolated from these results.</p>
                        <h5>Anxiety</h5>
                        <p>It is a little more difficult to study the use of CBD for mental health issues than for physical conditions. That being said, several animal and human studies  [22] have shown the promise of CBD oil for anxiety. CBD research in children, however, is somewhat limited. One study  [23] supports the effectiveness of CBD oil for pediatric anxiety and insomnia related to post-traumatic stress disorder. More research is needed to determine the effects of CBD oil for anxiety in children.</p>
                        <h2>How To Use CBD Oil & Gummies For Kids</h2>
                        <p>When it comes to using CBD, especially for children, it’s best to follow your pediatrician’s recommendations. There is no standard dosage for CBD, and children may require lower doses due to their smaller size. Recommended dosage varies from one product to another based on the concentration of CBD in the product, as well as the condition you’re treating.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, it may take time and a little trial and error to find the best CBD dosage for your child. Start with the lowest recommended dose to make sure your child tolerates it well, then increase the dosage if needed to obtain the desired effect.</p>
                        <h3>How to Find the Best CBD for Your Kids</h3>
                        <p>Because CBD has become a popular alternative to conventional treatment options, it’s pretty easy to find. The best place to shop may be online because you can compare different products and you’re not limited to the state in which you live (though be sure to check for shipping restrictions to certain states based on local regulations). </p>
                        <p>When shopping for CBD for a child, it’s especially important to find a product that is made from high-quality hemp and tested for purity and safety. Find out where the hemp is grown and where the product is manufactured. It’s also a good idea to check to see if the hemp is grown organically and that it’s free from pesticides and other toxins. Make sure the CBD product is tested by an independent lab (third-party) and look for a certificate of analysis (COA) with a certification from a reputable organization like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP).</p>
                        <p>If you’re new to CBD, you might want to consider starting with CBD gummies rather than CBD oil. These are convenient and easy to dose because they have a specific amount of CBD per gummy. Whatever product you choose, be sure to follow the dosing instructions on the label.</p>
                        <h3>Tips for Giving CBD to Children</h3>
                        <p>Cannabis users have a wide range of products to choose from. If you’re not familiar with CBD yourself, you may find it difficult to get used to dosing and administering CBD oil for your child. As an alternative, you might consider CBD gummies as an introduction. CBD gummies are simply chewable supplements that contain CBD. The flavor of CBD oil can be off-putting to some, so your child may even prefer CBD gummies. </p>
                        <p>If you choose to use liquid CBD tinctures, it’s best to administer it directly by mouth. Follow the dosing instructions on the CBD product and drop the liquid under your child’s tongue[24]. It’s best to hold the liquid in the mouth for a few seconds before swallowing so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream more effectively. </p>
                        <p>The benefits of CBD oil are the subject of an ongoing study, but CBD oil hasn’t been extensively researched for its use in children. Though it shows promise for certain conditions, it’s still important to follow your pediatrician’s advice and to use caution when choosing and administering a CBD product to a child.</p>
